# agent-sandbox configuration file
# Place this file at ~/.agent-sandbox.toml to configure default settings

[defaults]
# Default shell to use when connecting to sandboxes
# This will be used if no --shell option is provided
# Common options: "/bin/bash", "/usr/bin/fish", "/bin/zsh"
shell = "/usr/bin/fish"

# IMPORTANT: Make sure the shell is installed in your container!
# For new projects, fish is included by default.
# For existing projects, add fish to your .devcontainer/Dockerfile:
#
#   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
#       ... other packages ... \
#       fish \
#       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
#
# Then rebuild your sandbox:
#   agent-sandbox rm <sandbox-name>
#   agent-sandbox connect <sandbox-name>
#

[git]
# Git user configuration for sandboxes
# These settings will be applied to sandbox clones so commits
# made within sandboxes use the proper author information
